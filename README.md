 FPSO-LFAC Simulation

This repository contains MATLAB & Simulink scripts for simulating an FPSO-integrated Low Frequency AC (LFAC) transmission system, adapted from wind energy transmission models in the Brazilian SIN context.

## Description
The simulation replaces offshore wind farms with FPSO load units connected at the B2B-2 station. The model includes:
- Back-to-back converters
- Grid-forming and grid-following converters
- LFAC submarine transmission cable
- Voltage/frequency control & system stability tuning

## Project Goals
- Replace 16 wind turbines with 5 aggregated FPSO loads
- Tune B2B-2 station for offshore load consumption
- Integrate MATLAB script with Simulink design
