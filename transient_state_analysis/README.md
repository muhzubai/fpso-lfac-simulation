# Transient State Analysis – FPSO LFAC System

This folder contains the simulation framework for transient analysis of FPSO electrification using Low Frequency AC (LFAC) transmission.

The study includes:
- Back-to-back converter station modeling (onshore and offshore)
- DC-link filter and capacitor design
- LFAC subsea cable integration
- Grid-to-FPSO voltage and frequency conversion (60 Hz ↔ 20 Hz)
- MATLAB scripting for base values, control design, and system initialization

The primary script is under development in `Oil_Gas_Script.m`.

This module supports technical evaluation under Project 8 – TransBRCoast.
